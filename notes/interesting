Interesting classes:

collections.namedtuple():
	Allows access of a tuple field by name.
	Useful for SQL-type commands:
		EmployeeRecord = namedtuple('EmployeeRecord', 'name, age, title, department, paygrade')

		import csv
		for emp in map(EmployeeRecord._make, csv.reader(open("employees.csv", "rb"))):
			 print(emp.name, emp.title)

		import sqlite3
		conn = sqlite3.connect('/companydata')
		cursor = conn.cursor()
		cursor.execute('SELECT name, age, title, department, paygrade FROM employees')
		for emp in map(EmployeeRecord._make, cursor.fetchall()):
			 print(emp.name, emp.title)

itertools:
	Many iterator versions of builtins like map, filter, slice, zip
	Also has product(seq1, seq2) which calculates Cartesian product of sequences:
		useful instead of nested for loops?
	Also has infinite counters.
