I'm trying to make the model in this program jive as closely with
the database/spreadsheet model as possible.

Data is grouped in columns. Each column has a title and a type.
Lines are made up of two columns.
The length of the shortest column is the length of the line.

(Ideally, each column should be added to simultaneously, like
a relational table.)
